2022-04-14,Telecom & IT,Data Center Fire Detection and Suppression Market - Global Outlook & Forecast 2022-2027,"The study includes In-depth Analysis and Data-driven Insights on the Global Data Center Fire Detection and Suppression Market Report
The global data center fire detection and suppression market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.20%.
Key Market Highlights:
According to the Uptime Institute, between 2016 and 2020, there were 13 instances of publicly reported data center outages caused due to fires. The cost of an outage can lead to a loss of USD 5,000-USD 7,000 per minute for an operator, highlighting the requirement for robust fire safety equipment.
Gas-based fire suppression systems, using inert gas or clean agent suppression systems, are increasingly being adopted by data center operators in server rooms, and constitute over 80% of the overall market for fire suppression systems.
Industry standards under the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 10, NFPA 25, and NFPA 75, among others) set guidelines for data center fire detection and suppression. For instance, the NFPA 25 standard is used for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of the fire suppression system using water as a fire extinguishant.
A majority of center operators, especially hyperscale operators, are deploying Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus (VESDA) in data centers. For instance, DataPro Moscow One data center facilities installed VESDA and HFC 227 fire extinguishants for fire suppression in the facility.
Regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America will be the major areas of opportunity for vendors supplying fire detection and suppression equipment, such as Carrier, Minimax, and SEVO Systems, among others, owing to a rapidly evolving data center market.

Group II base oils is expected to be the largest segment in the base oil market. Group II base oils are more refined base oil than group I. These oils have clear color and better antioxidant properties than group I base oil owing to the saturated nature of their hydrocarbon molecules. However, group II base oils are more expensive than Group I. These base oils are primarily used in the textile industry, cutting oils, in the formulation of lubricants for turbines, heat pumps, exchangers, and engines owing to their impressive properties of wear & tear resistance, low friction, and better load-bearing capacity.
Automotive or engine oil is the largest segment amongst others in the base oil market. The main function of automotive oil is to reduce friction and wear & tear of the automotive engine and to clean the engine from sludge, and detergents. Earlier, group 1 base oil was used in automotive oil. Presently, group II and group III base oil are being highly preferred for manufacturing base oil driven by the emission regulation standard, increasing demand for low viscosity, low volatility lubricants, and increasing demand for better fuel economy is fuelling the demand for premium base oil.
There is a growing demand for automotive oil in Europe, APAC, and North America which is driving the demand for base oil. At the same time, the APAC market is also experiencing an escalating demand.

An increase in awareness regarding renewable and bio-based products has resulted in an upsurge in the demand for pine-derived chemicals over the past few years. Pine-derived chemicals is a major commercial product of pine trees and it is used in the manufacturing of paints & coatings, adhesives & sealants, surfactants, and printing inks. Major market players have been investing significantly in R&D to boost production to cater to changing consumer preferences.
""By type, the gum rosin segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period.""
Based on type, the gum rosin segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period. Gum rosin is the oleoresin that is harvested by the periodic wounding of the tree and collecting the sap into cups. During the production of synthetic rubber and printing inks, resin acids are modified for further industrial use. Apart from this, gum rosin is used in the paints & coating industries, owing to this the demand for gum rosin is increasing.
""By source, by-products of sulfate pulping segment is estimated to grow at higher CAGR.""
Sulfate processing is used to produce pine wood pulp, which consists of almost pure cellulose fibers by using sulfurous acid to extract the lignin from wood chips in digesters. Two main by-products, CTO and CST, are obtained in the pinewood pulping procedure. Both CTO and CST are used as a primary raw material to obtain pine chemicals like resins, fatty acids, etc. These pine chemicals demand is increasing due to their application in textile, fuel additives, construction chemicals, paints & coating, rubber, soaps & detergents, etc.
""By application, the adhesives & sealants segment is forecasted to account for the second-largest market share.""
Adhesives & sealants are versatile products that are obtained from pine trees. The automotive and construction industries are the two key sectors that use adhesives and sealants extensively. The natural stickiness of rosin makes it an ideal adhesion enhancer when added to adhesives and sealants. The players in the adhesives and sealants industry are expanding their presence across the globe.
""By process, the tapping process segment is anticipated to grow at higher CAGR during the review period.""
Tapping is a repeated wounding process of the tree trunk, which removes the bark and tissues beneath. There is a chemical stimulant application after this process to obtain Crude oleoresin, which is evaporated with steam distillation to obtain turpentine, molten rosin remains at the bottom after turpentine has been evaporated and recovered from a condenser. This rosin has a huge demand in the manufacturing of adhesives & sealants and paints & coatings.
""The North America region is the largest market for pine-derived chemicals during the forecast period""
North America is one of the largest markets for pine-derived chemicals worldwide as it holds a considerable share in the tall oil fatty acid segment. There has been a significant usage of pine-derived chemicals to produce a wide range of consumer products. North America has a developed market for pine-derived chemicals and is projected to grow at a steady rate.
