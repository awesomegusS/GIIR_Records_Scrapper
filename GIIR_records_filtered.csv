April 14 2022,Telecom & IT,Data Center Fire Detection and Suppression Market - Global Outlook & Forecast 2022-2027,"The study includes In-depth Analysis and Data-driven Insights on the Global Data Center Fire Detection and Suppression Market Report
The global data center fire detection and suppression market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.20%.
Key Market Highlights:
According to the Uptime Institute, between 2016 and 2020, there were 13 instances of publicly reported data center outages caused due to fires. The cost of an outage can lead to a loss of USD 5,000-USD 7,000 per minute for an operator, highlighting the requirement for robust fire safety equipment.
Gas-based fire suppression systems, using inert gas or clean agent suppression systems, are increasingly being adopted by data center operators in server rooms, and constitute over 80% of the overall market for fire suppression systems.
Industry standards under the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 10, NFPA 25, and NFPA 75, among others) set guidelines for data center fire detection and suppression. For instance, the NFPA 25 standard is used for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of the fire suppression system using water as a fire extinguishant.
A majority of center operators, especially hyperscale operators, are deploying Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus (VESDA) in data centers. For instance, DataPro Moscow One data center facilities installed VESDA and HFC 227 fire extinguishants for fire suppression in the facility.
Regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America will be the major areas of opportunity for vendors supplying fire detection and suppression equipment, such as Carrier, Minimax, and SEVO Systems, among others, owing to a rapidly evolving data center market.

GLOBAL BASE OIL MARKET SEGMENTATION
Group II base oils is expected to be the largest segment in the base oil market. Group II base oils are more refined base oil than group I. These oils have clear color and better antioxidant properties than group I base oil owing to the saturated nature of their hydrocarbon molecules. However, group II base oils are more expensive than Group I. These base oils are primarily used in the textile industry, cutting oils, in the formulation of lubricants for turbines, heat pumps, exchangers, and engines owing to their impressive properties of wear & tear resistance, low friction, and better load-bearing capacity.
Automotive or engine oil is the largest segment amongst others in the base oil market. The main function of automotive oil is to reduce friction and wear & tear of the automotive engine and to clean the engine from sludge, and detergents.

The global cladding systems market has witnessed high growth primarily because of the increasing infrastructure and construction activities worldwide. Not only these systems protect the building structure, but they also enhance the appearance of a building. Rebound in commercial construction is expected to increase the demand for the external cladding system.
""In terms of both value, and volume, the ceramic cladding segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.""
Ceramic is mainly used for tile cladding, and hence plays an important role in the construction industry. The ceramic tiles enhance the overall atmosphere of a residential or commercial landscape. The selection of the type of these tiles is based on several factors such as ease of maintenance, durability, comfort, safety, style, and design templates. Foot traffic plays an important role in the selection of the type of ceramic tiles. For example, government offices would require solid, highly durable floors due to high foot traffic. The wall tiles are employed in the interior as well as the exterior of the building to meet the requirements of decoration or aesthetics. The usage of ceramic tiles ranges from bathrooms and kitchens in households to laboratories, restaurants, medical centers, shopping centers, schools, and government buildings.
""In terms of both, value and volume, the wall segment is projected to lead the cladding systems market from 2020 to 2026.""
Wall claddings are designed to protect exterior wall from effects of weathering and to enhance the appearance of the walls in a building. Wall cladding with the use of materials such as ceramic, brick & stone, stucco & EIFS are gaining significant momentum, especially in residential buildings. In commercial buildings such as warehouses and manufacturing plants, concrete and metal form the main wall cladding systems. Concrete cladding such as slabs and precast panels are widely used in industrial applications. Metal cladding, for example steel, are also used in other industrial buildings such cool stores and freezing units.
""The residential segment is estimated to grow at highest CAGR during the forecast period, in terms of both value and volume.""
Demand for cladding in the residential segment is primarily attributed to the aesthetic appeal, along with properties such as durability and protection from extreme weather.
